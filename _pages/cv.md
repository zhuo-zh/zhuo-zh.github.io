Education
======
* M.S. in Integrated Circuit Engineering, Southeast University, 2028 (expected)
* B.E. in Integrated Circuit Design and Integrated Systems, Xi'an University of Posts and Telecommunications, 2024

Research experience
======
* Design and Implementation of a Blink Detection Circuit Based on the Inter-frame Difference Method
  * Undergraduate Thesis Project | Dec. 2023 – Jun. 2024
  * Developed a hardware-based blink detection system to address fatigue driving by monitoring blink frequency in real-time.
  * Researched and optimized the inter-frame difference algorithm for low-latency hardware acceleration.
  * Designed the complete digital logic in Verilog and performed functional simulations to ensure timing closure.
  * Integrated a hardware pipeline involving OV5640 camera data acquisition, FPGA-based image processing, and real-time LCD display.
  * Implemented real-time features including fatigue level calculation, bounding box marking, and status visualization on FPGA.
  * Supervisor: Yu Liu

* Design of a 5-Stage Pipelined Processor Based on RISC-V Architecture
  * Digital System Design Project | Dec. 2022 – Jan. 2023
  * Designed and verified a synthesizable 32-bit pipelined CPU supporting R, I, S, U, and J-type instruction sets.
  * Developed a standard 5-stage pipeline architecture (IF, ID, EXE, MEM, WB) using Verilog.
  * Implemented core modules including the Instruction/Data Memory, ALU, Register File, and Control Unit.
  * Supported 20 instructions and successfully resolved data and control hazards through Data Forwarding and Static Branch Prediction.
  * Completed the hardware-in-the-loop verification by deploying and testing the design on an FPGA development board.
